# Books-recommendation-by-collaborative-filtering
Collaborative filtering is a recommendation technique that predicts a user's preferences by analyzing the behavior and preferences of similar users. It is widely used in recommendation systems to provide personalized suggestions, such as movie or product recommendations, based on the past actions and preferences of a user and other users with similar tastes, ultimately enhancing the user's experience and aiding in content discovery.
